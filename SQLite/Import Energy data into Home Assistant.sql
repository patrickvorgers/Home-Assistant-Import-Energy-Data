/*
Definition of the different sensors for which the history data should be loaded.
Comment out the sensors for which no history data is available.

SENSOR NAME:
  Fixed, do not change this
SENSOR ID:
  Identifier (id) of the sensor as defined in the statistics_meta table
CORRECTION FACTOR:
  Correction factor in case the provided data uses a different unit of measurement than the target sensor (import data -> target sensor)
    Wh  -> Wh  : 1.0
    Wh  -> kWh : 1000.0
    Wh  -> MWh : 1000000.0
    kWh -> Wh  : 0.001
    kWh -> kWh : 1.0
    kWh -> MWh : 0.001
    MWh -> Wh  : 0.000001
    MWh -> kWh : 0.001
    MWh -> MWh : 1.0
    L   -> L   : 1.0
    L   -> m³  : 1000
    m³  -> L   : 0.001
    m³  -> m³  : 1.0
CUTOFF NEW METER:
  This value determines the cutoff value to determine when a new meter is installed. The value depends on the unit of measurement of the target sensor!
  Change this in case your new meter started with a higher start value.
  New meter detection: (difference between two sensor states < 0) and (state of sensor < cutoff new meter value)
    Wh  : 25000.0 Wh
    kWh : 25.0 kWh
    MWh : 0.025 MWh
    L   : 25000.0 L
    m³  : 25.0 m³
CUTOFF INVALID VALUE:
  This value determines when a value is considered to be invalid (too large). The value depends on the unit of measurement of the target sensor!
  Change this in case a higher/lower diff cutoff is needed to mark a value invalid.
  Invalid value detection: (difference between two sensor states > cutoff invalid value)
    Wh  : 1000000.0 Wh
    kWh : 1000.0 kWh
    MWh : 1 MWh
    L   : 1000000.0 L
    m³  : 1000.0 m³

Examples:
Wh -> Wh (import data is in Wh and target sensor data is in Wh)
correction cutoff_new_meter cutoff_invalid_value
1.0        25000.0          1000000.0

correction cutoff_new_meter cutoff_invalid_value
1000.0     25.0             1000.0
