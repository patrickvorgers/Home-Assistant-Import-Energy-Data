## About The Project

![2019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10108665/230038399-61886f6c-ba39-4343-8b96-0fb779b39ba2.JPG)

### Background

I have been enjoying the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard feature since it came out.
The only downside was that I could not import my historical energy/water data.
I was using "Toon" from my Dutch energyprovider Eneco until the Home Assistant Energy Dashboard came out.
This led me to write an import script that could import Toon data into Home Assistant.
After I got it working I made this specific import script as is available on GitHub.

Since then the import script has been used and adapted by several people so it could be used with other energy providers.
Their feedback led me to the idea to rewrite my initial script and make it more generic and robust so that it can be used easier with other energy providers.
The latest version of the script is independent from the energy provider and makes it possbile to import historical exported energy data into Home Assistant.
It adds the statistics data that is missing in Home Assistant and adjusts the existing data.

The import process consists of three straightforward steps:
1. **Data preparation**  
   Prepare the data in the correct CSV file format (`Epoch Unix Timestamp`, `sensor value`).
   For several energy providers conversion scripts exist that convert the energy provider specific format to the needed format.
   Additionally, a generic conversion script is available that can handle various formats such as CSV, XLS, XLSX, and JSON and can deal with headers, footers, date formats, data filtering and data recalculation.

2. **Import CSV files**  
   Use the generic import script `ImportData.py` to import the CSV files generated from step 1 into a temporary working table within the Home Assistant database.

3. **Process and import data**  
   Execute the database-specific version of the SQL script `Import Energy data into Home Assistant.sql` to process the temporary table, import the data into the appropriate Home Assistant tables, and adjust and integrate it with existing data.

**Latest data correct after import (short term statistics work)**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Disclaimer

Importing historical energy data into Home Assistant is not simple and requires some technical knowledge. It alters the database of Home Assistant so be sure that you <u><b>always</b></u> have a recent backup of your Home Assistant data!

<a name="How-to"></a>
### How-to

#### Source data preparation
- Check whether a script/how-to exists for your provider (datasources directory)
  - Script/how-to exists:
    - Follow how-to to prepare the needed CSV files
  - Script/How-to does not exist:
    - Determine how to get the data from your energy provider (download/API etc.)
    - Get the data from the energy provider using the identified method
        - Ensure that this data precedes the sensor data in Home Assistant while still overlapping with the current data. It is not possible to import data for a sensor that is later than the data in Home Assistant or to fill in any gaps; such data will be ignored because the Home Assistant data takes precedence.
    - Convert the data in the needed CSV files.
      The generic data conversion script ```TemplateDataPrepare.py``` can be used in most cases.
      In case the CSV files are created manually the CSV files should follow the following simple definition where each row contains: ```Epoch Unix Timestamp```, ```sensor value```.
      The filename must include both the sensor identifier and the resolution.
      The sensor identifier is used by the generic SQL script to map the data to the corresponding sensor defined in Home Assistant.
      - Example: `elec_feed_in_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv`
        - Sensor ID: `elec_feed_in_tariff_1`
        - Resolution: `HIGH`
        - Data
          - 1540634400, 8120605
          - 1540638000, 8120808
          - 1540641600, 8120993
          - 1540645200, 8121012
    - Depending on the used energy sensors, determine which CSV data files need to be created:
      - ```elec_feed_in_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv```
        - Contains the highest resolution usage data available (for instance: hour resolution)
        - Used in case there is only one tariff

        - Contains the lowest resolution usage data available (for instance: day resolution)
        - Used in case there is only one tariff

## Authors

The project initially began as a tool for importing historical data for Toon (Eneco) into Home Assistant. In early 2024, the project scope expanded, enabling the import of data from various energy providers.

Hopefully, together with the community, the number of supported energy providers (datasources) can be expanded. Making it easier to import data from various energy providers.

Please share scripts or how-to guides if you have built an integration with a new energy provider. Your name will be added to the list below as a contributor.
