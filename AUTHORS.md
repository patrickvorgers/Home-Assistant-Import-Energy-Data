Project Authors
===============

The project initially began as a tool for importing historical data for Toon (Eneco) into Home Assistant. In early 2024, the project scope expanded, enabling the import of data from various energy providers.

Hopefully, together with the community, the number of supported energy providers (datasources) can be expanded. Making it easier to import data from various energy providers.

Please share scripts or how-to guides if you have built an integration with a new energy provider. Your name will be added to the list below as a contributor.
