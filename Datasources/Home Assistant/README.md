# Energy provider: Home Assistant

Home Assistant stores information about all the tracked energy/water sensors within Home Assistant.
Sometimes it is needed to copy the history of an old energy/water sensor to a new energy/water sensor.
In that case it is possible to export the history of the old energy/water sensor and import it into the new energy/water sensor using the import script.
This howto describes how to export data from an existing Home Assistant energy/water sensor into the format that the script can use.

**Data provided**
- Electricity consumption - Tariff 1 - High resolution (hour interval)
- Electricity consumption - Tariff 2 - High resolution (hour interval)
- Electricity production - Tariff 1 - High resolution (hour interval)
- Electricity production - Tariff 2 - High resolution (hour interval)
- Solar production - High resolution (hour interval)
- Gas consumption - High resolution (hour interval)
- Water consumption - High resolution (hour interval)

**How-to (Home Assistant):**

This scenario can be used in case Home Assistant is available and can be used to export data.

##### Export and import the data
- Goto `Home Assistant`
- Go to the `History` tab
- Select `Choose entity` and select the Energy Dashboard entity you want to export
- Adjust the `Start date` and `End date`
- In the top-right corner select the 3-dots
- Select `Download data`
- Download the `HomeAssistantDataPrepare.py` file and put it in the same directory as the Home Assistant history data
- Execute the python script with as parameter the name of the file that contains the exported data `python HomeAssistantDataPrepare.py history.csv`.
  The python script creates the needed file for the generic import script.
  To import data from multiple exports, use `?` or `*` in the filename to match multiple files.
  To produce the right output filename the output file definition can be changed accordingly.
  See [Generic how-to](../../README.md) `Source data preparation` section for more information about the supported filenames.
```python
# List of one or more output file definitions
outputFiles = [
    OutputFileDefinition(
        "elec_feed_in_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv",
        "state",
        [],
        False,
    )
]
```
- Follow the steps in the overall how-to

**How-to (SQLite database):**

This scenario can be used in case the SQLite database is available and Home Assistant is not available anymore.

##### Tooling
- Download and install: DB Browser (64 bit) for SQLite https://sqlitebrowser.org/ (tested windows version 3.12.2)

##### Export the data
- Start `DB Browser for SQLite`.
- Open the database (`Open Database`) that has been backed up in the [SQLite how-to](../../SQLite/README.md).
- Lookup in the `statistics_meta` table the ID of the sensor for which the data should be exported (Browse Data -> Table: `statistics_meta`; You can use "filter" to find the ID of the sensor).
<br>Example:
`
        id  statistic_id                                source      unit_of_measurement
        6   sensor.gas_meter                            recorder    m³
        7   sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_1   recorder    kWh
        8   sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_2   recorder    kWh
        9   sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_1  recorder    kWh
        10  sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_2  recorder    kWh
        352 sensor.solar_energy_produced_today          recorder    kWh
        450 sensor.battery_energy_feed_in               recorder    kWh
        451 sensor.battery_energy_feed_out              recorder    kWh
        653 sensor.watermeter_quantity_m3               recorder    m³
`
- Go to the `Execute SQL` tab and paste in the contents of the `HomeAssistant Export.sql` file.
- Change the SQL script and fill in the ID of the sensor. The remark `/* Change */` has been added in the SQL statement for the line that needs to be changed.
- Execute the SQL and wait for it to complete.
- In the `Execute SQL` tab select the 4th button from the right (hovertext: `Save the results view`). In the dropdown box select `Export to CSV`.
- Deselect `Column names in first line` and use `,` as value for `Field separator` and press `Save`.
- Provide the correct name for the file (see [Generic how-to](../../README.md) `Source data preparation` section) and save the file.
  - elec_feed_in_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv
  - elec_feed_in_tariff_2_high_resolution.csv
  - elec_feed_out_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv
  - elec_feed_out_tariff_2_high_resolution.csv
  - elec_solar_high_resolution.csv
  - elec_battery_feed_in_high_resolution.csv
  - elec_battery_feed_out_high_resolution.csv
  - gas_high_resolution.csv
  - water_high_resolution.csv

**How-to (MariaDB database):**

This scenario can be used in case the MariaDB database is available and Home Assistant is not available anymore.

##### Tooling
- Download and install: HeidiSQL https://www.heidisql.com/

##### Export the data
- Start `HeidiSQL`.
- Open a session to the Home Assistant MariaDB database, see [MariaDB how-to](../../MariaDB/README.md) for information regarding setting up the intial connection and creating a backup of the database.
- Lookup in the `statistics_meta` table the ID of the sensor for which the data should be exported (Select table: `statistics_meta` and select the data tab on the right. You can use `filter` to find the ID of the sensor, For instance: `statistic_id LIKE '%sensor.gas_meter%'`).
<br>Example:
`
        id  statistic_id                                source      unit_of_measurement
        6   sensor.gas_meter                            recorder    m³
        7   sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_1   recorder    kWh
        8   sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_2   recorder    kWh
        9   sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_1  recorder    kWh
        10  sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_2  recorder    kWh
        352 sensor.solar_energy_produced_today          recorder    kWh
        450 sensor.battery_energy_feed_in               recorder    kWh

`
- Go to the `Query*` tab and paste in the contents of the `HomeAssistant Export.sql` file.
- Change the SQL script and fill in the ID of the sensor. The remark `/* Change */` has been added in the SQL statement for the line that needs to be changed.
- Execute the SQL and wait for it to complete (Shortcut: F9).
