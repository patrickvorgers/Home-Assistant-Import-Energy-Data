# Energy provider: P1Mon (ZTATZ)

P1Mon offers the option to export data from the local database. This data can be transformed and used to import into Home Assistant.

**Data provided**
- Electricity consumption - Tariff 1 - High resolution (hour interval) - kWh
- Electricity consumption - Tariff 2 - High resolution (hour interval) - kWh
- Electricity production - Tariff 1 - High resolution (hour interval) - kWh
- Electricity production - Tariff 2 - High resolution (hour interval) - kWh
- Gas consumption - High resolution (hour interval) - m³
- Water consumption - High resolution (hour interval) - m³

**Tooling needed**
- Python 3
- Pandas python library `pip install pandas`
- Tzlocal python library `pip install tzlocal`
- OpenPyXL python library `pip install openpyxl`

**How-to**
- Export data from P1Mon.
  - Go to P1Mon's local IP address or URL
  - Go to `configuation and Settings` and login with the password
  - Select the 'in-export' tab
  - Select 'Excel Export' and choose 'e_historie.db'
  - The data will now be downloaded to your PC
  - Optionally: Consolidate the minute interval data into hourly data. (Having minute data significantly reduces performance)
- Download the `P1MonDataPrepare.py` and/or `P1MonWaterDataPrepare.py` and the `DataPrepareEngine.py` (Datasources directory) files and put it in the same directory as the P1Mon data
- Execute the python script with as parameter the name of the file that contains the exported data `python P1MonDataPrepare.py e_historie.db.xlsx`. The python script creates the needed files for the generic import script.
- Follow the steps in the overall how-to
